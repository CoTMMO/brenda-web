# Brenda Web Interface
> The goal of this project is to create a web interface that allows users to easily submit and manage Blender render jobs submitted via [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/). Right now the backend heavily relies on the work done by James Yonan. See the github project, titled Brenda at [jamesyonan/brenda](https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda).

# Milestones

[Beta 1.0 - Coming Late July](https://github.com/robksawyer/brenda-web/milestones/Beta%20Version%201.0)

# Getting Started

1. See the SailsJS [Getting Started](http://sailsjs.org/#!/getStarted). You mostly need to install nodejs.
1. `git clone https://github.com/robksawyer/brenda-web.git`
1. `cd brenda-web`
1. Run the command `npm install` to download the node modules used in the project.
1. Set Amazon keys as environment variables. See setting up [AWS](#AWS-config) below.
1. Open your Terminal ([iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/))
1. Run the command `sails lift`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:1337`

# Server Configuration

## AWS (Amazon)

The following environment variables need to be set. The app also uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). So you could just make a file named `.env` with these environment variables in it.
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```
