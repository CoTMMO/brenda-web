# Brenda Web Interface
> The goal of this project is to create a web interface that allows users to easily submit and manage [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) render jobs submitted via [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/). And more specifically, via [Amazon EC2 Spot Intances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/spot-instances/). Right now the backend heavily relies on the work done by James Yonan. See the github project, titled Brenda at [jamesyonan/brenda](https://github.com/jamesyonan/brenda).

# Milestones and Progress

[Beta 1.0 - Coming Late July](https://github.com/robksawyer/brenda-web/milestones/Beta%20Version%201.0)

Be sure to check out the progress report at [PROGRESS.md](https://github.com/robksawyer/brenda-web/blob/master/PROGRESS.md) for the latest feature list and status.

# Getting Started

1. See the SailsJS [Getting Started](http://sailsjs.org/#!/getStarted). You mostly need to install nodejs.
1. `git clone https://github.com/robksawyer/brenda-web.git`
1. `cd brenda-web`
1. Rename `config/local.sample.js` to `config/local.js`. This contains local configuration variables that the app can use.
1. Run the command `npm install` to download the node modules used in the project.
1. Set Amazon keys as environment variables. See setting up [AWS](https://github.com/robksawyer/brenda-web#aws-amazon) below.
1. Open your Terminal ([iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/))
1. Run the command `sails lift`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:1337/register` and create an account.
1. Click your `username` in the navigation bar to enter the Settings page.

# Configuration

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)

The following environment variables need to be set.

Environment Variables
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

You could also just add the following to your `config/local.js` file.
```
aws: {
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
        region: 'us-west-2'
      }
   }
```

# Technology Stack

## Web/NodeJS Framework
- [Sails](http://sailsjs.org)

## NPM Packages
- [skipper-s3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skipper-s3): Streaming file uploads to S3
- [skipper-s3-alt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skipper-s3-alt): An alternative skipper driver for upload files in AWS S3
- [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk): Amazon SDK for Node
- [knox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knox): Amazon S3 client
- [aws-q](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-q): Give the AWS SDK some Q promise magic
- [adm-zip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adm-zip): Automatically zipping .blend files in order to push to Amazon S3
- [moment](http://momentjs.com/) - Formatting time data

## Other Dependencies
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net): Log window and live feedback display. See [Recreate Similar Travis CI Console Log Interface](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30948708/recreate-similar-travis-ci-console-log-interface/30957814#30957814).

# Data Storage
The project is currently dependent on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) as its data storage provider. [mongo-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-express) is used as a gui to make life a bit easier. It's also worth noting that all of this is made possible, because of the [sails-mongo](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo) Waterline adapter.

Visit your mongo-express interface at <http://localhost:8081>.

> There's a helper script to start mongo-express. Just run `npm run mongo` to start it up. You can change this in `package.json`.

## Setting up MongoDB locally
1. Install it via Homebrew
1. Make a data storage location `sudo mkdir /data/db`
1. Change ownership to your user `sudo chown [yourusername] -R /data`
1. Create a config file with the following and save at `/etc/mongo.conf`
```
processManagement:
   fork: true
net:
   bindIp: 127.0.0.1
   port: 27017
storage:
   dbPath: /data/db
systemLog:
   destination: file
   path: "/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log"
   logAppend: true
storage:
   journal:
      enabled: true
```
1. Create a log location `sudo mkdir /var/log/mongodb`
1. Change the read/write props `sudo chmod -R 777 /var/log/mongodb`
1. Start up `mongod` with the config file using `mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf`.

# Wuh? What is Brenda?
- [Blender Cycles Cloud Render Farming Using AWS, Deadline and Brenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkZ60lF-nKM) is a great introduction to the software.

# Resources
- [Brenda Pro Forum](http://brendapro.com/forum/) - A great resource to get started with Brenda.

# Inspiration
- [Render.st](https://render.st) - Good interface!
- [Flamenco](http://www.flamenco.io/)
- [Brender](http://www.brender-farm.org/) - I believe this became Flamenco.
